ABOUT

OpenDroidPDF is an Android PDF viewer and annotation app built on top of MuPDF and originally forked from Christian Gogolin’s open-source Android PDF editor. OpenDroidPDF aims to make editing PDFs as easy as writing on a piece of paper while remaining fully open source under the GNU AGPLv3.

HISTORY / ATTRIBUTION

OpenDroidPDF maintains full attribution to its upstream lineage (the 2015–2016 Android PDF editor authored by Christian Gogolin and the MuPDF project). Attribution notes describe that history, but OpenDroidPDF is the only user-facing brand for this fork.

COMPILING

If you are compiling from source you will need several third party libraries:
freetype2, jbig2dec, libjpeg, openjpeg, and zlib. These libraries are contained
in the source archive. If you are using git, they are included as git
submodules.

You will also need the X11 headers and libraries if you're building on Linux.
These can typically be found in the xorg-dev package. Alternatively, if you
only want the command line tools, you can build with HAVE_X11=no.

The new OpenGL-based viewer also needs OpenGL headers and libraries. If you're
building on Linux, install the mesa-common-dev and libgl1-mesa-dev packages.
You'll also need several X11 development packages: xorg-dev, libxcursor-dev,
libxrandr-dev, and libxinerama-dev. To skip building the OpenGL viewer, build
with HAVE_GLFW=no.

The latest development source is available directly from the Git repository:
