OpenDroidPDF License (“OpenDroidPDF License”)
===============================================

*Earlier drafts used the legacy project label; this edition aligns the wording with the OpenDroidPDF brand while preserving the same legal commitments.*

Preamble
--------

OpenDroidPDF is an open-source project for Android PDF viewing and annotation, built upon Christian Gogolin’s 2015–2016 Android PDF editor and the MuPDF rendering engine. Both the upstream Android editor and MuPDF are licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License version 3 (AGPLv3), a strong copyleft license. To remain fully compatible with these upstream projects and uphold all AGPLv3 obligations, the OpenDroidPDF License incorporates the core terms of AGPLv3. In particular, it ensures that anyone who uses, modifies, or distributes OpenDroidPDF must make the complete corresponding source code available under the same license, preserve all original copyright notices, and offer any modified version back to the community. This license explicitly permits broad public collaboration (e.g. via GitHub pull requests) and encourages reuse of the code in other open source projects, provided those projects also use an AGPLv3-compatible license. No additional restrictive terms are added beyond AGPLv3; the goal is to foster a collaborative environment where improvements remain free and open for all users.

Note on Upstream Attribution: This project includes code from Christian Gogolin’s original Android PDF editor and from MuPDF. We respectfully acknowledge these upstream projects and their contributors. All distributions of OpenDroidPDF must retain existing copyright notices from these projects and this project. This preservation of attribution is both an AGPL requirement and good open-source citizenship. If the software provides an “About” dialog or similar interface, it should display Appropriate Legal Notices (e.g. a copyright notice and a statement of no warranty) as required by AGPLv3 Section 5(d).

Below are the terms and conditions of the OpenDroidPDF License. It is a customized license text derived from AGPLv3, written in plain legal language for clarity. It includes necessary clauses on source disclosure, redistribution, contributions, and third-party components (such as fonts), to ensure full compliance with AGPLv3 while facilitating public development and use.

Terms and Conditions
--------------------

### 1. License Grant and Copyleft

We license OpenDroidPDF to you under the GNU AGPLv3 (version 3.0 of the Affero GPL). You may use, run, study, copy, and modify this software for any purpose, including commercial or private use. You may also distribute the software, with or without modifications, under the condition that any distribution (or deployment for public use) is made under this same license (AGPLv3). In other words, if you share this software (in source or binary form), or make it available to users over a network, you must do so under AGPLv3 and not add any further restrictions. This ensures that all modified versions remain free and open source for the community, and no derivative work can be relicensed as proprietary software.

Rationale: This clause carries over AGPLv3’s core copyleft requirement: any larger work or modified version that you convey must be licensed as a whole under AGPLv3 as well. It guarantees that the “open-source-ness” of OpenDroidPDF follows any updates or additions to the code. By using AGPLv3, we protect user freedom and ensure that improvements contribute back to the public commons, especially for software deployed on servers.

### 2. Source Code Availability (Including Network Use)

If you distribute or make available this software or a modified version to others – whether by sharing binaries, publishing it as an app, or providing it as a service over a network – you must provide access to the complete corresponding source code of the version you are running. This source code must be provided at no charge and under the same AGPLv3 license. For software distributed as an application, you can satisfy this requirement by including the source code in the distribution or by providing a clear written offer (for example, in documentation) giving instructions on how to obtain the source. For software used on a server (network use), AGPLv3 explicitly treats this as a form of distribution: if users can interact with your modified version over a network, you are required to promptly offer them the source code of that modified version (for example, by providing a prominently visible link to a source code repository).

Rationale: This clause implements the famous AGPL “network interaction” provision. Under GPLv3 alone, one could run a modified program on a server without releasing the source, because no traditional distribution occurred. The AGPL closes that loophole by mandating that remote users have rights to the source code. Here we make it clear that any form of public use – whether distributing binaries or SaaS deployment – triggers the obligation to share source code under the same license. This guarantees community access to improvements, fulfilling AGPLv3 Section 13. Practically, if you run a modified OpenDroidPDF on a website or service, you must let users download the corresponding source code of your modified version. Similarly, if you share an APK of a modified app, you should accompany it with source or a written offer for source. This ensures transparency and freedom to modify the software remains with the users.

### 3. Modification and Redistribution under Same License

You are free to modify OpenDroidPDF or incorporate parts of it into your own projects, provided that any resulting software is also licensed under AGPLv3. You must preserve this license text in all copies or substantial portions of the software, and include a notice of any significant changes you make. For example, if you fix a bug or add a feature, add a brief note in the source (or changelog) stating that you modified the software and the date. When redistributing the original or modified software, you must retain all copyright notices and attributions from the upstream projects (the 2015–2016 Android editor by Christian Gogolin and MuPDF) and from OpenDroidPDF itself. You may add your own copyright notice for your contributions, but you cannot remove or alter the existing ones. All redistributions must include a copy of the full license (this document) and the attribution notices.

In summary, you can redistribute the software (original or modified) only under this same license, with source code and notices intact. You may not relicense it under different terms or add extra restrictions. (The only exception is that you may offer additional permissions that ease use in some way, but you cannot impose further constraints that conflict with AGPLv3’s terms.)

Rationale: This clause encapsulates standard GPL/AGPL conditions: keep the license and copyright notices, state any changes, and ensure downstream users get the same rights you received. By requiring the same license for modified versions, we uphold AGPLv3’s intent that the software (and any larger work using it) remains under copyleft. Preserving author attributions and copyright notices is legally required (you cannot falsely claim original work as yours or remove credit) and explicitly allowed as an additional term under GPLv3 Section 7(b). It also honors the work of upstream contributors. In practical terms, if you reuse code from OpenDroidPDF in your project, your project must also be AGPLv3-licensed, and you should keep a NOTICE file or header comments acknowledging OpenDroidPDF and its upstream components. This encourages a virtuous cycle where improvements in one project benefit all others using the code.

### 4. Collaboration and Contributions

We encourage public collaboration on OpenDroidPDF. You are welcome to contribute improvements or fixes (for example, by forking the project and submitting pull requests on platforms like GitHub). By contributing to this project, you agree to license your contribution under the same AGPLv3 license so that it can be merged and distributed as part of the project. In other words, all contributions will be treated as AGPLv3 from the outset, and must comply with the same terms (including source disclosure, etc.). You retain the copyright to your contributions, but you grant the project and all users the perpetual right to use, modify, and redistribute your contributions under AGPLv3.

We do not require a separate Contributor License Agreement (CLA) for this project; the act of submitting a contribution (e.g. a GitHub pull request) with the understanding of this license is sufficient to grant permission. However, by making a contribution, you represent and warrant that the contribution is your original work (or you have rights to submit it) and that it does not violate any third-party copyrights or patents. Each contributor also grants a patent license for any patents they hold that would be infringed by their contribution, to the extent required by AGPLv3’s terms. This ensures the community can use the contributions freely without concern of patent litigation from contributors.

Rationale: This clause clarifies how contributions from multiple authors are handled under a copyleft license. According to GitHub’s Terms of Service, when you contribute to a repository that has an open source license notice, you automatically license your contributions under the same terms. We’re making this explicit so contributors are aware that their code will be AGPLv3 as well. The clause about warranties and originality is to protect the project and its users from legal troubles (a standard expectation in open-source development). The patent grant is a built-in part of GPLv3/AGPLv3 (Section 11) which says that contributors implicitly grant users a license to any patents reading on their contribution. We restate it here in plain language for transparency. Overall, this encourages a healthy collaborative ecosystem: anyone can contribute improvements, and those improvements become part of the AGPL-licensed codebase that others can use.

### 5. Attribution and Notices

All copies or substantial uses of OpenDroidPDF must include appropriate attribution to the project and its upstream components. This means you must preserve all copyright statements and license notices in the source code and documentation. For example, files that contain headers like “© 2025 OpenDroidPDF contributors” or references to the 2015–2016 Christian Gogolin codebase or MuPDF should remain intact in modified versions. If you create a user interface (e.g., an “About” dialog in an app), it should display an “Appropriate Legal Notice” as defined by AGPLv3. Typically, this would include: (1) a copyright notice (e.g., “© 2025 OpenDroidPDF Developers, © 2015-2016 Christian Gogolin, © 2006-2025 Artifex Software, Inc. (MuPDF), etc.”), (2) a statement that the program has no warranty (e.g., “No warranty, provided as-is”), and (3) a notice that the program is licensed under AGPLv3 and a pointer to where the user can read the full license. You may group multiple notices on an “About” or “Licenses” screen as is common in mobile apps, rather than cluttering the UI. The key point is that credit to prior authors and information about the license must remain visible to users of the software, in accordance with AGPL requirements and standard open source practice.

If you modify the software, you should add your name (or your organization’s name) to the CONTRIBUTORS or copyright notice list, noting the year of your contributions. For example, in a header or README: “Modified by Alice Contributor, © 2025”. You must also indicate that the software has been modified (for instance, “Based on OpenDroidPDF, with modifications” or a change log entry). This helps downstream users identify the provenance of the code and who to credit for portions of it. Do not remove or falsify existing attribution – doing so would violate this license and possibly copyright law.

Rationale: Attribution is an important aspect of many open source licenses. AGPLv3 itself requires keeping copyright and license notices intact (Section 4) and allows additional terms to require preservation of certain attributions or legal notices (Section 7(b)). Our project builds on existing AGPL code, so giving credit to upstream authors (Christian Gogolin for the original Android editor, Artifex for MuPDF, etc.) is both legally required and ethically right. This clause spells out in concrete terms how to fulfill those obligations (e.g., by not removing notices and by displaying license info in the UI). It’s worth noting that preserving attribution does not mean you need to display a splash screen logo of upstream projects or anything extreme; it simply means retaining the text notices and including appropriate credits in documentation or “About” sections. By doing this, we show appreciation for the shoulders we stand on, and we make it clear to end-users that the software is open source with a known license. This transparency builds trust and complies with the letter and spirit of AGPLv3.

### 6. Third-Party Components and Fonts

This project may include third-party open source components, such as libraries or font files, each of which may have its own license terms. All such components are intended to be compatible with the AGPLv3 license. For example, OpenDroidPDF might bundle fonts from the Google Noto Fonts project or others for PDF rendering. Many open-source fonts are licensed under the SIL Open Font License (OFL) 1.1 or similar permissive licenses. Any included font files remain under their original licenses, which will be distributed alongside our project (see the third-party licenses directory or font license headers for details). You must comply with the specific license requirements of these assets when you copy or redistribute them. Typically, this means you can use, embed, and redistribute the fonts freely as long as you include the font’s license text and copyright notice in your distribution, and you do not remove or obscure that license. The OFL, for instance, allows bundling, embedding, and redistribution of the font software, but requires that the fonts (and any derivative fonts) stay under the OFL license and not be sold by themselves. We include such fonts only under licenses that are compatible with AGPLv3, so their presence does not impose any conflicting restriction on the overall program.

Clarification on font usage: Using the fonts in output documents (e.g. displaying or embedding them in a PDF that a user creates) does not by itself subject those documents to the AGPL or the font’s license. Font licenses like the OFL explicitly state that documents created using the font are not required to be licensed under the OFL. Likewise, the AGPLv3 license of our software does not extend to user-generated PDF files or content. Those are considered separate works; you own the content you create. This license only covers the software code of OpenDroidPDF and its included assets, not the PDFs or data you produce with it.

Rationale: We want to address font licensing because PDF tools often include or embed font files. Fonts have unique licensing needs. By clarifying this, we ensure that developers and distributors know their obligations. Including a font under OFL (or another open font license) means you must keep that font under the same license and include the license file when redistributing. This is in harmony with AGPLv3 (which allows combining with other licenses as long as they don’t impose stricter terms than AGPL). The note that documents produced aren’t covered by this license is important to encourage adoption: someone using OpenDroidPDF to view or annotate PDFs should be confident that their PDF content isn’t “contaminated” by copyleft. Indeed, both the font’s license and AGPLv3 support that separation. In summary, this clause is about being transparent and responsible with third-party components: respect their licenses (attribution, share-alike if any, etc.) and understand that they are included to make the software work but do not change the licensing of user data.

### 7. No Additional Restrictions

You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed by this license. This means you cannot, for example, distribute a modified version of OpenDroidPDF under a non-disclosure agreement, or add terms that would require royalty payments, or forbid others from using specific features. The intent is that this software remains free software in perpetuity, available for broad public use and collaboration. Every recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors to use, modify, and distribute the work, subject to these same terms – no more, no less. If you attempt to impose any further incompatible conditions on the software, that action will be void and invalid, and may terminate your rights under this license. (For instance, AGPLv3 Section 8 explains that if you initiate litigation claiming patent infringement against the program, your rights can terminate.)

Rationale: “No additional restrictions” is a standard clause in copyleft licenses (AGPLv3 Section 10). We highlight it to make it crystal clear that you cannot take OpenDroidPDF and make it less free. The software’s openness is protected: everyone downstream gets the same rights. This clause preserves the AGPL compatibility – it ensures we have not introduced any term that would conflict with AGPLv3 or make the license non-free. In practice, this means the license you’re reading is essentially AGPLv3 with clarifications, and wherever there’s any doubt, AGPLv3’s official terms prevail. This protects the ecosystem of AGPL software: OpenDroidPDF code can be reused in other AGPLv3 projects without any legal headaches, and vice versa, because the rules are the same. The emphasis on prohibiting additional restrictions also encourages sharing. It assures contributors and users that the project won’t suddenly be subject to new rules that cut off collaboration or commercialization under fair terms. As the Free Software Foundation notes, copyleft licenses are designed to guarantee your freedom to share and change software – this clause is a guardrail to keep that promise.

### 8. Disclaimer of Warranty and Liability

OpenDroidPDF is provided “AS IS”, without warranty of any kind. To the extent permitted by law, the developers and contributors disclaim all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. You accept the software on an “as-is” basis, understanding that it might have bugs or deficiencies. You bear all risks associated with using this software.

In no event and under no legal theory (whether in contract, tort, or otherwise) shall any contributor or copyright holder be liable to you for any damages, including any direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from the use of this software or inability to use it, even if such parties have been advised of the possibility of such damages. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation of liability for certain types of claims, so these disclaimers may not fully apply to you. In such cases, and if any warranty or liability is found to exist by law, such warranty is limited and such liability is limited to the minimum extent required by law.

Rationale: This clause is the standard warranty disclaimer and liability limitation found in GNU licenses (see AGPLv3 Sections 15 and 16). It is crucial for open source projects because developers typically distribute the software for free and cannot assume responsibility if something goes wrong when others use it. By using OpenDroidPDF, you acknowledge that you have no guarantee it will work perfectly or meet your needs, and you cannot hold the authors liable for any issues. This encourages developers to contribute without fear of legal repercussions from unforeseen problems. Legally, this section notifies users that, except where disallowed by law, they have no right to claim damages from the developers. This doesn’t remove any rights that cannot be disclaimed (for example, some consumer protection rights), but it sets the expectation that the software is a community-provided tool without any service level agreement. Such clauses are compatible with the Open Source Definition and are present in essentially all OSI-approved licenses. Remember: free software comes with no warranty – that’s a core principle of GNU licenses, and we uphold it here for clarity.

### 9. License Version and Compatibility

This license is based on GNU AGPLv3 (2007). For simplicity and maximum compatibility, OpenDroidPDF is released under “AGPL v3.0 only”, meaning that this exact version of the license applies. (It is not currently offered “AGPL v3 or later,” because the project includes code from upstream that was licensed under AGPL v3.0-only, which precludes using future versions without permission.) However, if the Free Software Foundation publishes a revised or new version of the Affero GPL in the future, the project maintainer may choose to upgrade the project’s licensing to that new version, provided it remains compatible with the requirements herein and with the dependencies’ licenses. Any change of license version will be notated in the project documentation and license file.

As of now, AGPL version 3.0 is the governing license. This means OpenDroidPDF code can be combined or integrated with other software that is licensed under AGPLv3 or GNU GPLv3 (with an explicit statement to aggregate with AGPL) without issue. (Note: Combining AGPL and GPL code within one program effectively requires the combined whole to be released under AGPLv3, as the AGPL’s additional network clause would apply. This is permitted since GNU licenses allow such relicensing for combining code.) We encourage reuse of OpenDroidPDF in other open source projects, and using the widely-recognized AGPLv3 framework helps facilitate that. If you use part of OpenDroidPDF in another project, simply credit this project and apply AGPLv3 to your project as well, so that users of your software have the same rights and duties.

Rationale: This final clause clarifies the license scope and version. Both the upstream Christian Gogolin codebase and MuPDF are AGPL-3.0, not “or later,” so our project must also be AGPL-3.0 only to comply with their terms. We note that for now, we stick to version 3.0. The mention of potential future versions is just to leave room for license evolution (for instance, if AGPLv4 ever came out and we wanted to adopt it, we could — but only if it didn’t break the compatibility or obligations we have). We explicitly mention how compatibility works: AGPLv3 and GPLv3 code can be combined if the result is under AGPLv3. This is an important detail for third-party reuse – it means if someone wants to merge our code with a GPLv3 project, they can do so by switching that project to AGPLv3 (GPLv3 code can be upgraded to AGPLv3 in context, as permitted by an FSF clarification). By encouraging usage in other AGPL projects, we align with the idea that free software licenses are most powerful when they are widely adopted and understood. Using AGPLv3 ensures anyone familiar with GPL licenses will understand their obligations and rights, making collaboration easier. In short, this clause is about transparency on which license version applies and assuring developers that our license won’t suddenly deviate in a way that breaks AGPL compatibility.

Conclusion
----------

The OpenDroidPDF License as outlined above is essentially the GNU AGPLv3 tailored to our project. It upholds all AGPL requirements – source disclosure (including for network use), preservation of notices, same-license distribution, and contributor patent grants – while providing clarity on collaboration and third-party components. By adhering to AGPLv3, we ensure the license is legally sound and OSI-approved, and by articulating the terms in plain language, we hope to make it easier for developers and contributors to understand their rights and responsibilities. This license is meant to empower you to use the software freely and contribute back, creating a cycle of improvement and sharing that benefits everyone. Thank you for helping build and use OpenDroidPDF under these terms of freedom and collaboration.
