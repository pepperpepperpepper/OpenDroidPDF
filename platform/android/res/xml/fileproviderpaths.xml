    Allow exposing any file under the app cache directory. We still only
    generate URIs inside cache/tmpfiles/ at runtime, but some devices/ROMs
    resolve the canonical cache path differently which can break when the
    path element is too specific. Using path "." avoids
    IllegalArgumentException("Failed to find configured root that contains ...").
