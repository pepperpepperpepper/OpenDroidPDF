Changelog: https://fdroid.uh-oh.wtf/changelog/org.opendroidpdf.txt
CurrentVersion: 1.3.54
CurrentVersionCode: 115
Description: |-
  OpenDroidPDF is an Android PDF viewer and editor focused on pen input,
  ink annotations, and offline document workflows. The project is derived
  from the original 2015–2016 Android PDF editor authored by Christian
  Gogolin, rebranded under the OpenDroidPDF name, and remains fully free /
  open-source under the GNU AGPLv3.

  Key capabilities:
    • Draw or erase ink annotations with adjustable width and color
    • Insert free-text blocks directly on top of documents
    • Save or export edited PDFs for sharing
    • Works fully offline; no proprietary SDK dependencies

  This metadata file feeds the self-hosted F-Droid repo at
  https://fdroid.uh-oh.wtf/repo so deployment scripts can keep the package info
  in sync with the org.opendroidpdf applicationId.

MaintainerNotes: |
  - Builds run via Gradle inside `platform/android` using the `assembleRelease`
    task. External dependencies (MuPDF, etc.) are checked into the repo to keep
    builds reproducible.
  - The release APK is signed outside of F-Droid, then copied into the hosted
    repo (`/home/arch/fdroid/repo`). This metadata is kept here for reference
    and automated validation scripts (jq checks) rather than for upstream F-Droid.
