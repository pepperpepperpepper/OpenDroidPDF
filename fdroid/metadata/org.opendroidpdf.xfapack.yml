Description: |-
  OpenDroidPDF XFA Pack is an optional companion app for OpenDroidPDF.

  It helps with **some** XFA (XML Forms Architecture) PDFs by converting them
  into a more compatible PDF:
    • Convert to form: removes the `/XFA` marker from *hybrid/static* XFA PDFs so
      the embedded AcroForm fields can be filled in OpenDroidPDF.
    • Flatten to PDF: produces a non-form PDF copy (fields flattened).

  Notes:
    • Dynamic XFA forms (no AcroForm fallback) are not supported.
    • This app provides a bound converter service and has no UI of its own.
    • Conversion happens fully offline (no network).

MaintainerNotes: |
  - This is a self-hosted F-Droid repo. APKs are built with Gradle and signed
    outside of F-Droid, then copied into the hosted repo.
  - The XFA Pack must be signed with the same signing key as OpenDroidPDF, and
    the main app verifies the signature match before binding to the converter
    service.
