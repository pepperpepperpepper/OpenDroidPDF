CurrentVersionCode: 127
Description: |-
  OpenDroidPDF Office Pack is an optional companion app for OpenDroidPDF.

  It enables offline import of Word documents by converting `.docx` files to
  PDF on-device, so the main OpenDroidPDF app can render, search, annotate,
  and export them through the normal PDF pipeline.

  Notes:
    • This app provides a bound converter service and has no UI of its own.
    • Conversion happens fully offline (no network).
    • `.doc` (legacy Word) may be unsupported.

MaintainerNotes: |
  - This is a self-hosted F-Droid repo. APKs are built with Gradle and signed
    outside of F-Droid, then copied into the hosted repo.
  - The Office Pack must be signed with the same signing key as OpenDroidPDF,
    and the main app verifies the signature match before binding to the
    converter service.
