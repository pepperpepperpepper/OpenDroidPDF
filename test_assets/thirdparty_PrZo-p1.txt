Hedge funds and trading firms are piling into physical commodities markets in search of new sources of
returns, despite lacking the decades of experience and information accumulated by established players such
as Trafigura and Vitol.
Financial firms have a long history of trading contracts for power, natural gas and oil. But hedge funds such
as Balyasny, Jain Global and Qube, as well as trading firm Jane Street, are expanding their operations to
allow them to trade the underlying markets, deepening their exposure to global price swings.
This can involve buying the rights to transport natural gas over a pipeline, buying storage capacity for crude
oil and storing electricity in advanced batteries before offloading it at peak demand times. Trading these
markets can confer an informational advantage to market participants.
“It’s an information gold rush,” said Michael Alfaro, chief investment officer of hedge fund Gallo Partners,
which is focused on energy and industrials. “When you’re trading physical commodities, you’re privy to a
lot of information and you get a sense of what is actually happening from economic shifts before the actual
data comes in.”
Multi-manager hedge fund Balyasny has expanded its power trading teams and researchers in Europe by
hiring from utilities such as Centrica and Norlys, and has added natural gas traders.
Multi-strategy hedge fund Jain Global this year bought Anahau Energy, which specialises in natural gas
services, and is now actively trading the commodity.
